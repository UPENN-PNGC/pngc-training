# PNGC Training Repository

This repository hosts courses, workshops, and training materials affiliated with the Penn Neurodegeneration Genomics Center (PNGC).

## Course Submission & Approval Process

To submit a new course, please use the [course registration issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/register-course.yml). After submission, a maintainer will review your entry.

**Note:** Courses are organized by year and semester. Approved submissions are automatically added to the lists below, and a folder is created for each course.

## Organization

- Courses are grouped by year and semester (Fall, Spring, Summer).
- Each course has a folder: `semester_year_course_title` (e.g., `spring_2026_IntroToGenomics`).
- If a course requires a Binder, a `binder/` folder is created inside the course folder with configuration placeholders.
