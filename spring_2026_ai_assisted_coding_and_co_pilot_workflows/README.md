# AI-assisted coding and Co-pilot Workflows
    ## Description
    AI-assisted coding tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude can significantly enhance coding workflows by generating functions, improving code structure, writing test cases, and helping document modules using natural-language instructions.  In this seminar, participants will explore how developers can use these assistants to accelerate development, enhance readability, and maintain reliability through testing and human validation.
