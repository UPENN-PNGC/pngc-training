# AI-assisted coding and Co-pilot Workflows

## Description

AI-assisted coding tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude can significantly enhance coding workflows by generating functions, improving code structure, writing test cases, and helping document modules using natural-language instructions.  In this seminar, participants will explore how developers can use these assistants to accelerate development, enhance readability, and maintain reliability through testing and human validation.

## Course Requirements

To fully illustrate the capabilities of Conversational and Agentic AI to enable AI-assisted coding, we will be using Copilot in Visual Studio Code.  To be able to actively participate in discussions and demo activities, you will need to bring a laptop and make sure you have installed the following software.  

- Python 3.7+
- Visual Studio Code: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
- Enable Copilot: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup>
- course sample data:

```bash
# Clone just this course folder using git sparse-checkout:
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/UPENN-PNGC/pngc-training.git
cd pngc-training
git sparse-checkout set spring_2026_ai_assisted_coding_and_co_pilot_workflows
```

> **Note:** The free tier of Copilot in VSCode will enable you to follow along with most of the demo.  If you want to explore Agentic AI tools along with me(running tests, direct code edits), you will need to sign up for the one month free trial of the Pro version: <https://github.com/github-copilot/pro>.  You will need a GitHub account to do this.
