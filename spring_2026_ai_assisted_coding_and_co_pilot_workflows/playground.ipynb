    "**Description:**\n",
    "AI-assisted coding tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude can significantly enhance coding workflows by generating functions, improving code structure, writing test cases, and helping document modules using natural-language instructions. In this seminar, participants will explore how developers can use these assistants to accelerate development, enhance readability, and maintain reliability through testing and human validation.\n",
